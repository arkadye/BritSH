# BritSH

Bash, but for the British.

**Features**

- Fully featured language, very similar to the already familiar bash.

- No more need for Americanisms, such as "-or" or "-ize" suffixes, or dollar signs.

- Enforces the British values of politeness, gratitude, and passive-aggressive error messages.

**Dependencies**

- Currently some dependencies on bash, but 51.8% of the development team believe that the BritSH project would be more strong and stable if we take back control, and cut all ties with bash. We're 100% sure the changeover will have no notable effect, and will reap great rewards in the next fifty to seventy years.
